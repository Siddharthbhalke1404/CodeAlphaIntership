Projects Of My Internship

1)Project_1:

Iris flower classification is a classic machine-learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their physical features. The dataset typically includes measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, and petal length. These features classify the flowers into three main species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

The task is to train a classification model (such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, or support vector machines) to predict the species of an iris flower based on these attributes. Due to its simplicity and well-structured data, this problem is widely used in machine learning as a benchmark for evaluating different algorithms. The Iris dataset is often utilized in educational settings to teach data analysis, machine learning techniques, and classification methods.


2) Project_2:

Car prices depend on brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. In this project, you'll train a machine-learning model to predict car prices based on these attributes. The process involves collecting and preprocessing data, engineering features, training algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest, and evaluating model performance. This project is a practical way to apply machine learning to solve a real-world problem in the automotive market.
